This is an idea I had this morning, I wanted to play around with the OpenAI API to generate something.

So I thought about creating a script that sends me a phrase in different languages every day, but just three milliseconds after that, I thought... "hey why not make it public so anyone can use it?".

It took me a couple of hours to put everything together, but here it is, a simple script that sends you a phrase in a random language every day _(this last sentence was written by GitHub Copilot, but it's not a lie, you can look at the messy commit history and see for yourself how creativity flowed this morning)_.

And yeah not the cleanest code ever, but it works, and I'm happy with it.

If I like what it does, I will maintain and improve it.
